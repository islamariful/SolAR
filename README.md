# SolAR

## An Augmented Reality model of our Solar System,
###### With accurate orbits and orbital times!

## Disclaimer: cloning this repository and running it in an IDE like Visual Studio Code won't produce what is shown in the video
## That is because more files, 'Assets', and rendering software are needed to get to the final product.

# SolAR [demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1xw5ywqqeY)

## An in-depth explanation behind how to use the scripts/Unity3D and Vuforia to get to the final product is on my [Medium article] (https://islamariful.medium.com/solar-c39ff260b8e5)

I left out the assets used to create my version of the SolAR app on purpose so as to simply the code and process for others and allow for creativity.
